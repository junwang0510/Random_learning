Game Theory -- How might people act in different circumstances?

<br>

## Prisoner's Dilemma
Locally optimal decisions lead to globally worst decisions when no communication is allowed for prisoners. 

Dominating strategy -- optimal strategy no matter what the other player does.

## Normal Form Games
- N players
- A set of actions for each player
- A payoff for each player for each choice of actions (payoff functions for different inputs)

e.g. Rock, Paper, Scissor

<br>

## Find Dominating Strategies
Strictly dominating -- All possible outcomes of one strategy is better than those of other strategies

Steps:
- Create a payoff matrix
- Fix a choice for one player 
- Analyze whether all decisions are dominating for the player regardless of how others act

<br>

## Mathematics of Trust
Nash Equilibrium -- A stable state where no player has an incentive to change their strategy

Trust &rarr; Maximize return

Don't Trust &rarr; Minimize cost

*Both decisions are at the Nash Equilibrium*

## Nash Equilibrium
- Not all nash equilibriums are equally desirable (possibility)
- Certain coordination is recommended to pick a better nash equilibrium

<br>

## Evolution of Cooperation
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma:

Playing the games multiple times

&darr;

Develop understandings of each other

&darr;

Apply different strategies to try to maximize personal return in the long run

<br>

Strategies:

- Prober -- Cooperate often and be selfish seldomly
- Grudge -- Cooperate until others start being selfish
- Tit for Tat (Best on Average) -- "copy" what others did in this round in the next round (be generous or selfish depending on others)

<br>

Properties of Successful Strategies:

- Nice (seek cooperation)
- Retaliating (punish other's selfishness)
- Forgiving (not punishing forever)
- Non-envious (not always seeking personally optimal strategy)
